## Upset Plot for describing categories

```{r cars}
upset(data=vacunas, intersections = NOM_VACUNA,group.by = COD_NUHSA_ENCRIPTADO, order.by = "freq")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
